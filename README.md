With this program we have made these functionalities:
  + Given the number of rows and columns of an hipothetic maze it exports it as a json file with all its data and a jpeg image with the drawn maze.
  + Given a json file it check if the cells neighbours are consistent and it as well exports the jpeg image representing the maze.

Befor running the program it is necessary to install two modules:
  + pygame: `python -m pip install -U pygame --user`
  + colorama: ``

The way of running it is:
    + `python -B main.py`
