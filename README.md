With this program we have made these functionalities:
  + Given the number of rows and columns of an hipothetic maze it exports it as a json file with all its data and a jpeg image with the drawn maze.
  + Given a json file it check if the cells neighbours are consistent and it as well exports the jpeg image representing the maze.
  
The way of running it is:
    + `python -B main.py`
